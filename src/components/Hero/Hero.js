        Hi. I'm Bohdan, nice to meet you. ðŸ«  <br />
        Fascinated with how intricate programming can be, I was quickly drawn to learn more. I started learning JavaScript and was even more
        enthused with making websites interactive. I am
        now spending my time building projects with React JS and
        learning new technologies. <br />
